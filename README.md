# Inverse-Design

In collaboration with Mr. Vishnu Prasannan, under the supervision of Prof. Saswata Bhattacharya

This project focuses on developing an inverse design methodology within a Bayesian framework, integrated with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). The objective is to infer critical unknown parameters by leveraging experimental data as the target.

Below are the simulations of the 2D heat equation trained on physics-informed neural networks with initial, boundary, and PDE loss. In their final epoch, the GIF demonstrates the flow of heat across different time scales.
